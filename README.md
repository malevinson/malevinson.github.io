# My Projects ✨

## Hacker News React

I used the Hacker News API for a better view of recent posts. The default sort is by Comment to Rating ratio which means that the most interesting and debatable articles are at the top. You can also sort by Rating, Comments, or Default.

## Music Dashboard

This app helps me organize and listen to my favorite artists. Sort your artists by ranking, name, date added, or randomly. Then pin a few to queue up those you want to listen to.
